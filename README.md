MongoDB-Framework-PHP
=====================

A MongoDB interface and ODM (assistant) all in one. Extremely flexible for any project.

# Overview

This is a set of helper methods and functions that I've used to make MongoDB development faster to develop.

## Normalizing

There are two normalizing methods that can take an object ID or an array of IDs and turn them into the objects they represent.

## IDs as Strings

All IDs are strings. No converting between MongoIDs and strings.
